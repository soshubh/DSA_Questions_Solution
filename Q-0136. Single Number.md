# _leetCode_ Question: [136. Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)

Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a **linear** runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

## Aproch

- The trick is here the XOR operator, we know a ^ a = 0 and x ^ 0 = x;
- if every element is comming twice in the array, XOR of all element will be zero
- and if there is nay number that dosn't occure twice itt will remain at last.

* ## Time complexity O(n)

## JAVA code:
  
```JAVA
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int ans = nums[0];
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length ; i++){
          ans ^= nums[i];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

### If the array was sorted, the then we will apply binary search,
