# _leetCode_ Question: [657. Robot Return to Origin](https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-return-to-origin/)

There is a robot starting at the position `(0, 0)`, the origin, on a 2D plane. Given a sequence of its moves, judge if this robot ends up at `(0, 0)` after it completes its moves.

You are given a string `moves` that represents the move sequence of the robot where `moves[i]` represents its `i`<sup>`th`</sup> move. Valid moves are `'R'` (right), `'L'` (left), `'U'` (up), and `'D'` (down).

Return `true` _if the robot returns to the origin after it finishes all of its moves, or `false` otherwise_.

Note: The way that the robot is "facing" is irrelevant. `'R'` will always make the robot move to the right once, `'L'` will always make it move left, etc. Also, assume that the magnitude of the robot's movement is the same for each move.

## JAVA code:

```JAVA
class Solution {
    public boolean judgeCircle(String moves) {
        int x = 0;
        int y = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < moves.length(); i++){
            char move = moves.charAt(i);
            if(move == 'U'){
                y++;
            } else if(move == 'D'){
                y--;
            } else if(move == 'L'){
                x--;
            } else{
                x++;
            }
        }

        return x == 0 && y == 0;
    }
}
```
